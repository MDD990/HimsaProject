#ButtonGrid Widget Sample

The **ButtonGrid** widget provides a cross-platform grid of buttons that automatically lay themselves out in the view similar to the iOS native Dashboard control. 

This example shows a basic window with eight buttons on the button grid.

1. To use this sample, launch Studio and create a new Titanium Alloy Project. File -> New -> Titanium Alloy Project. Ensure that iPhone, iPad, Android, and Mobile Web deployment targets are checked. Uncheck the *automatically cloud-enable this project* check box.
1. Copy the contents of the widget_buttongrid folder to your project folder/app directory.
1. Build and run your project!

Alternatively, if you have downloaded the alloy project from github you can:

1. Open a terminal window
1. `cd <alloydir>`
1. `sudo jake app:run dir=widgets/widget_buttongrid platform=<platform> tiversion=<version>` 

Where `<platform>` is one of iphone, ipad, mobileweb, android and `<version>` is the version of the SDK you want to use (e.g. 2.1.3.GA).

The ButtonGrid widget is defined in a separate 'widgets' subdirectory. See the documentation for [com.appcelerator.ButtonGrid](https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/blob/master/widgets/com.appcelerator.buttongrid/docs/README.md) for more information.
